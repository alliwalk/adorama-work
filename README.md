# tachyons-for-adorama

I recently discovered Tachyons.io, a CSS design system. I used this framework to create a portfolio page to describe the work I did at Adorama a few years ago. 

My goal with the page was to learn more about Tachyons and test how it works as a CSS framework.

I used the following components, along with header, columns, and styles for typography:

- Left Title Top Border: http://tachyons.io/components/articles/left-title-top-border/index.html
- Left Title: http://tachyons.io/components/articles/left-title/index.html
- Footer, Simple Large Type: http://tachyons.io/components/footers/simple-large-type/index.html
- Swiss Cover Five Columns: http://tachyons.io/components/pages/swiss-cover-five-columns/index.html

There are only about 5 lines of original CSS.
